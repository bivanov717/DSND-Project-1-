# DSND-Project-1

## Project motivation
In this repo you'll find the analysis I did for the data scientist nanodegree using public data from Kaggle on hotel reservations. I was interested in finding out: 

1.	What is the lead time of bookings, does this differ if it is a family holiday and how is price related to lead time?
2.	What are the features that highly correlate to price (Average Daily Rate)?
3.	What are the most popular months for holidays? 

## File Description

For this project there are:
-	one data file - DSDN Project 1 Hotel Data.csv
-	one notebook available - DSDN Project 1.ipynb

## Requirements

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotplit
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook(only if running locally)

## Results
